Introduction

Forests are more than trees — they cool the air, store carbon, and save lives.

Today, satellites, sensors, and health data give us millions of data points about forests.

With Data Analysis + AI, we can understand the impact of deforestation and act faster.

 Case 1 — Deadly Heat from Deforestation

Data used: satellite images, local temperature, mortality data.

Findings: around 28,000 deaths per year linked to heat caused by deforestation.

Data Analysis role: showed the direct link between tree loss and human deaths.

AI role: Computer Vision detects deforestation automatically from satellite photos.
Impact: proved that protecting forests = protecting human health.

 Case 2 — 500,000 Deaths in 20 Years

Source: Nature Climate Change study.

Data used: global forest loss maps + climate data + mortality stats.

Findings: half a million deaths in 20 years due to heat from forest loss.

AI role: predictive models simulate “what if” scenarios (future deaths with/without deforestation).
Impact: data turns abstract “climate change” into measurable human cost.

Case 3 — Colombia Reduces Deforestation

Data used: satellite monitoring + environmental reports.

Action: communities + government + AI-based monitoring.

Result: deforestation down by 33% in 2025; in national parks – down 54%.
Impact: shows that combining data analysis and action leads to real change.

 Data → Analysis → AI → Impact

Data Collection: satellites, sensors, health statistics.

Data Analysis: correlations (forest loss → higher temperature → more deaths).

AI: automates detection, predicts risks, supports decision-making.

Impact: better policies, less illegal logging, lives saved.

 Conclusion

Data analysis and AI make invisible things visible: they show the hidden cost of deforestation.

Forest protection is not just about nature — it’s about people’s lives.

With the right data and AI tools, governments and communities can act faster and smarter.
